# CHEAT

CHEAT stands for C Header Embedded Automated Testing or something like that.
It is a convenient unit testing framework for the C programming language.
It has no dependencies and requires no installation or configuration.
Only a header file and a test case is needed.

	#include <cheat.h>

	CHEAT_TEST(mathematics_still_work,
		cheat_assert(2 + 2 == 4);
		cheat_assert_not(2 + 2 == 5);
	)

The following section presents the basic use case;
you can skip to section 2 if you are only looking for an overview.

## 1   Getting Started

In this introduction it is assumed that you are running a Linux system with
the GNU Core Utilities and the GNU Compiler Collection installed.
None of that is necessary, but it makes the introduction easier to follow.
Compatibility with other tools and operating systems is addressed in section 4.

### 1.1   Preparing

First you need to download the main header

	[user@computer:~]$ wget http://github.com/Tuplanolla/cheat/raw/master/cheat.h

and move it to a suitable location like the global search path

	[user@computer:~]$ sudo mv -i cheat.h /usr/include

or the working directory of your project.

	[user@computer:~]$ mv -i cheat.h project

Then you are ready to write tests.

### 1.2   Writing Tests

Tests go into their own source file.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ cat > tests.c
	#include <cheat.h>

It is an ordinary file with the exception that it is processed more than once.
Therefore you must wrap all top level declarations and definitions with
the appropriate preprocessor directives.
The reason for that is found in section 2.3.

Including the main header is enough to get an empty test suite, but
such a thing is not very useful beyond making sure everything is set up right.
The next step is to define tests.
You can define tests with `CHEAT_TEST(name, statements)` and
their success conditions called assertions with `cheat_assert(bool expected)`.
Doing so is demonstrated in the example file.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ wget http://github.com/Tuplanolla/cheat/raw/master/example.c
	[user@computer:~/project]$ mv -i example.c tests.c

The example also shows how you can declare global variables with
`CHEAT_DECLARE(declarations)` and manage them with
`CHEAT_SET_UP(statements)` and `CHEAT_TEAR_DOWN(statements)`, which
are executed before and after each test respectively.

A detailed explanation of the entire interface is in section 3.2.
However it is important to note that the state of all global variables that
are mutable (as in modified by any execution path) is undefined when
the set up or, in case there is no set up, a test begins.

It is time to run your new tests.

### 1.3   Running Tests

Tests compile into an executable

	[user@computer:~/project]$ gcc -I . -o tests tests.c

that takes care of running the tests and reporting their outcomes.
There are two things that need to be taken care of when compiling a test suite.
First you have to add the directory of the test suite to the search path, as
is done here with `-I .`.
Then you have to make `__BASE_FILE__` point to the test suite, by
using `-D __BASE_FILE__=\"tests.c\"` or such, if the compiler does not.
The reason is related to the previous oddity and again found in section 2.3.

The resulting executable runs tests in a security harness if possible, so
the suite does not crash or hang if one of its tests does.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ ./tests
	..:..??..!..
	---
	tests.c:81: assertion in 'philosophy_never_worked' failed: 'heap == stack'
	tests.c:104: assertion in 'important' failed: 'THIS_TEST == IMPORTANT_TEST'
	---
	8 successful and 2 failed of 12 run
	FAILURE

The results are reported in five parts.

The first part is the progress bar, where

* a success is a green dot,
* a failure is a red colon,
* a crash is a red exclamation mark,
* a time out is a yellow exclamation mark and
* an ignored outcome is signaled with a yellow question mark.

The second part contains diagnostic messages in
a format similar to what many popular C compilers produce.

The third and fourth parts, which are omitted here, hold the contents of
the captured standard output and error streams.

The fifth and last part, which is always shown, briefly summarizes what
the outcome of the test suite is.
A test suite is considered successful if and only if
every single one of its tests completes without failing a single assertion.
The outcome is also reflected by the exit code of the process.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ echo returned $?
	returned 1

You can change the behavior of the test suite with command line options or
force running individual tests by giving their names as arguments.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ ./tests --list --minimal | xargs ./tests
	..:..:.:..!..
	---
	example.c:81: assertion in 'philosophy_never_worked' failed: 'heap == stack'
	example.c:104: assertion in 'important' failed: 'THIS_TEST == IMPORTANT_TEST'
	example.c:112: assertion in 'pointless' failed: '(0 | ~0) == 0'
	---
	9 successful and 4 failed of 13 run
	FAILURE

The option syntax is specified in section 3.3.

### 1.4   Using Extensions

There is an extension header in addition to the main header.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ wget http://github.com/Tuplanolla/cheat/raw/master/cheats.h

It is supposed to be used as a supplement and
expects the main header to be included first.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ cat > tests.c
	#include <cheat.h>
	#include <cheats.h>

It provides specialized assertions like
`cheat_assert_double(double actual, double expected, double tolerance)` and
`cheat_assert_string(char const* actual, char const* expected)` for
they require less typing and provide more detailed diagnostic messages.

Its features are demonstrated in the additional example file.

	[user@computer:~/project]$ wget http://github.com/Tuplanolla/cheat/raw/master/examples.c
	[user@computer:~/project]$ mv -i examples.c tests.c

You can read more about the extensions in section 3.4.

Hopefully you have now gotten started by now.

## 2   Overview

### 2.1   License

CHEAT is free software and
as such licensed under the simplified BSD license with two clauses.
The full license can be found in the `LICENSE` file that
resides in the same directory as this file.
In short, copies and derivative works are permitted as long as
they use the same license.
It would be licensed under the GNU GPL, but
the authors felt that such a decision would hinder its adoption.

### 2.2   History

The project was started on 2012-08-07 and first released on 2014-08-07.
It was originally written by Guillermo "Tordek" Freschi for
the entertainment and education of everyone in
the ISO/IEC 9899 community on Freenode.
The prototype was later picked up by Sampsa "Tuplanolla" Kiiskinen who
grew tired of unit testing frameworks that suck and
wondered what happened to the one that did not.
It was rewritten, stuffed with new features and
finally audited in a small scale.

### 2.3   Implementation

The working principle is best explained by a thought experiment.

> Imagine a source file including a header file.
> Then imagine the header file including the source file that included it.
> Now imagine doing that three times in a row within the same header file.
> Proceed to imagine redefining all of the identifiers each time.
> Finally imagine doing all of that with preprocessor directives.
> What you ended up with is CHEAT.

It sounds strange, but it works.

### 2.4   Correctness

Everything in the project is built with extreme care and attention to detail.
While the authors are quite confident the project is free of serious bugs,
they are mere mortals and not well versed in certified programming.

### 2.5   Contributing

The support for Windows and other more exotic operating systems is not complete.
For example stream capturing is currently very limited without POSIX interfaces.

Contributions in the forms of feedback and pull requests are all very welcome!

## 3   Usage

### 3.1   Files

The project contains other useful files in addition to the main header.
You can acquire them by cloning the repository

	[user@computer:~]$ git clone git@github.com:Tuplanolla/cheat.git
	[user@computer:~]$ cd cheat

or downloading the clone directly.

	[user@computer:~]$ wget http://github.com/Tuplanolla/cheat/archive/master.zip
	[user@computer:~]$ unzip master.zip
	[user@computer:~]$ mv -i cheat-master cheat
	[user@computer:~]$ cd cheat

In addition to the main header there is an extension header and
examples of how to use them with various compilers.

	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ less example.c examples.c
	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ make -f makefile.gcc

The extensions are introduced in section 3.4.

There are also tests for corner cases,

	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ ls tests
	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ ./test

supplementary reading material

	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ man ./cheat.7
	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ sudo cp -i cheat.7 /usr/man/man7
	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ sudo gzip /usr/man/man7/cheat.7

and things used during development.

	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ xdot streams.dot
	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ tcc -run meta.c 4
	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ rm -i windowed.h

### 3.2   Interface

Tests can be defined with `CHEAT_TEST(name, statements)`, where
`name` must be a valid identifier and `statements` a list of statements.
The identifier must not conflict with an existing preprocessor directive.
For example `putc` is not a valid identifier, because
it is reserved by the standard library and
`exit` and `write` may not be valid unless `CHEAT_NO_WRAP` is defined, because
procedures that resemble continuations or effects are wrapped by default.
The list of statements must not be empty or ambiguous.
For example `int x, y;` may be interpreted as an invalid parameter list if
the compiler does not support `__VA_ARGS__`.
Solutions to that are presented in section 5.5.

Tests can also be defined with
`CHEAT_IGNORE(name, statements)` and `CHEAT_SKIP(name, statements)`.
They work like `CHEAT_TEST(name, statements)` with the exception that
the outcome of the former is ignored and the latter is not executed at all, but
only when they are not explicitly requested to be run.
That feature is explained in section 3.3.

Repeated tests can be defined with `CHEAT_REPEAT(name, statements)`, which
is otherwise identical with `CHEAT_TEST(name, statements)`, but
the statement list is repeated until a failure or
`CHEAT_REPETITIONS` is reached.
Its purpose is to make working with stochastic tests less of a hassle.

Manually interrupting tests that have already failed can be achieved by
calling `cheat_yield(void)` in the appropriate place.
It must not be used outside test cases or compatible procedures, because
it can only alter the control flow of the procedure it is called from.
Here compatible procedures mean procedures that have the same type as
`CHEAT_GET(name)` for any valid `name`.

Tests need success conditions called assertions and
those can be checked with `cheat_assert(bool expected)` or
its logical complement `cheat_assert_not(bool unexpected)`.
The condition is satisfied if `expected` is true or, in other words, not zero.

In addition to tests it is possible to write global declarations by
putting them inside `CHEAT_DECLARE(declarations)`, where
`declarations` must be a valid list of top level declarations or definitions.
Preprocessor directives do not need it since
an `#ifndef` condition works similarly.
Global definitions can also contain assertions and be called from within tests.

Running code before and after each test can be done with
`CHEAT_SET_UP(statements)` and `CHEAT_TEAR_DOWN(statements)`, where
`statements` is a list of statements with the same restrictions as before.
There can be only one set up and one tear down in a test suite.

The names given to tests are not directly used identifiers, but
the identifier of a test can be retrieved with `CHEAT_GET(name)`, where
`name` must match the name of the test.
Pointers to test procedures have the type `cheat_procedure` or
equivalently `void (*)(void)`.

The convenient `CHEAT_CALL(name)` is equivalent to `CHEAT_GET(name)()`.

The behavior of the test suite is primarly controlled with command line options.
However some of the options are compiled into the test suite and
their default values can be overridden by
defining them before including the main header.

The `size_t CHEAT_REPETITIONS` option controls the amount of
repetitions done by `CHEAT_REPEAT(name, statements)`.
Its default value is `256`.

The `size_t CHEAT_LIMIT` option determines how long string literals in
diagnostic messages can be.
Its valid values go from `3` to `SIZE_MAX - 1` and
the default is the maximum length of a string literal required by the standard.

The `CHEAT_TIME` option sets the maximum time after which
unresponsive tests are terminated if such a thing is possible.
It is always stored in milliseconds, but its type is implementation defined.
The default value is two thousand and therefore equal to two seconds.

The `int CHEAT_OFFSET` option changes the range of
exit codes used for internal interprocess communication.
The only reason it exists is to stop serious crashes that
use reserved error numbers from showing up with the wrong outcome.

The `CHEAT_NO_MAIN` option removes the `main` procedure from the test suite,
making it possible to link it with other object files.
It is not very useful.

The `CHEAT_NO_WRAP` option prevents wrapping procedures that
resemble continuations or effects.
Such procedures include `exit`, `printf`, `fwrite`, `fflush` and `perror`.
It is only useful if the tests rely on
the exact way they call standard library and system procedures or
their names clash with existing preprocessor directives.

Wrapping can be undone with `CHEAT_UNWRAP(name)` instead of turning it off or
repeated with `CHEAT_WRAP(name)` if it is already turned off.

The expansion of commas can be delayed with `CHEAT_COMMAS(...)` or,
in case `__VA_ARGS__` is not available, with `CHEAT_COMMA` or
the matching `CHEAT_COMMAS_` n `(x1, x2,` ... `)`, where
n is the amount of commas in the argument list.
For example `CHEAT_COMMAS(int x, y;)`, `int x CHEAT_COMMA y;` and
`CHEAT_COMMAS_1(int x, y;)` all expand to `int x, y;`.

### 3.3   Options

Test suites obey a basic set of command line options so that
they do not need to be recompiled after every change.
There are options and names with slightly different semantics.

Options begin with a dash.
They are parameterless, essentially orderless and case insensitive.
Each of them has a long and a short form that work identically.
Everything else is considered a name.
Since names might start with a dash, there is a special `--` option that
disables parsing and so turns the arguments that come after it into names.

For example the command `./tests -e x --plain -- -ed` would
treat `x` and `-ed` as a names and the rest as options.

It is safe to use wrong or conflicting options, because
they are checked before anything else is done.

The `-h` for `--help` option briefly summarizes all of the options.

The `-v` for `--version` option prints the name of the project and its version.

The `-l` for `--list` option lists the names of all of the tests.

The `-s` for `--safe` option enables a security harness that
runs tests in isolated processes if `fork()` or `CreateProcess()` is supported.
The `-d` for `--dangerous` option provides an alternative harness that
runs everything in the same process, but provides some stability by
attempting to recover from fatal signals like `SIGFPE` and `SIGSEGV`.
It most likely leads to undefined behavior, but
luckily undefined behavior is often defined enough behavior.
The `-u` for `--unsafe` option disables all security measures.

The `-t` for `--timed` option enables terminating unresponsive processes and
the `-e` for `--eternal` option disables doing so.

The `-n` for `--noisy` option enables capturing and displaying the contents of
the standard streams and the `-q` for `--quiet` option enables them.

As an added bonus the `-c` for `--colorful` option makes everything colorful if
the output terminal has ISO/IEC 6429 escape sequence support,
the `-m` for `--minimal` option makes those things machine readable and
the `-x` for `--xml` option does nothing for good measure.

The default options depend on the target platform.

### 3.4   Extensions

Specialized assertions can be checked with
the matching `cheat_assert_` i `(` t ` actual, ` t ` expected)`, where
t is its type and i is an identifier built from the type.

The `CHEAT_NO_MATH` option disables floating point extensions that
use a few mathematical functions and
therefore may require compiling the test suite with `-lm` to link `libm`.

### 3.5   Design Decisions

Empty tests and test suites are both have successful outcomes, because
every predicate is true for the empty set, so why not choose favorably?

## 4   Portability

### 4.1   Standards Compliance

CHEAT follows the original language specification, ISO/IEC 9899:1990, and
the first POSIX specification, IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, to the letter.
It also takes the newer revisions, both
ISO/IEC 9899:1999 and IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, into account whenever possible.

The project does not require a POSIX system to work, but it helps, because
only the most critical features are universal and
just a few of the rest are compatible with Windows.

While the project does not rely on a particular compiler,
it is easier to use with some of them.
Specialized build automation scripts are provided to
help hammer out common problems and save you from needless frustration.

	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ make -f makefile.gcc

 

	computer# make -f makefile.tcc

 

	E:\CHEAT> makefile.bat

You can see screenshots of them in section 6.

### 4.2   Language Compatibility

The project is designed for C, but also works with C++.
It abides by ISO/IEC 14882:1998 as far as is reasonable.

Hopefully it is not an issue to wade through a million warnings.

	[user@computer:~/cheat]$ make -e CC=g++ -f makefile.gcc

## 5   Bugs and Limitations

CHEAT is naturally fickle, because it is built with heavy preprocessor abuse.
Some problems are impossible to fix, so they are collected into this section.

### 5.1   Identifiers

Identifiers starting with `CHEAT_` and `cheat_` are reserved for
internal use as C does not have namespaces.
Extensions reserve identifiers starting with `CHEATS_` and `cheats_` as well.

### 5.2   Base File

If the compiler does not define `__BASE_FILE__`, then
the test suite will fail to compile.

Luckily it can be to set to `__FILE__` at the beginning of the test suite

	#ifndef __BASE_FILE__
	#define __BASE_FILE__ __FILE__
	#endif

or defined manually.

### 5.3   Commas

Using commas directly inside preprocessor directives like
`CHEAT_TEST(name, statements)` without support for `__VA_ARGS__` causes
everything that comes after them to be interpreted as extra arguments.

The solution is to delay the expansion of the commas as
described in section 3.2.

### 5.4   Expressions

The expressions given to `cheat_assert(bool expected)` and friends should be
at most 509 characters long since they are converted into string literals and
the limit of their length may be that low.

### 5.5   Broken Compiler

If the compiler works like Microsoft C/C++ (commonly known as `cl.exe`) and
defines both `__BASE_FILE__` and `__FILE__` wrong, then
the test suite will be empty.

The definition should be fed to the compiler manually.

### 5.6   Debugging

It is not possible to attach a breakpoint to
any of the identifiers that are part of the public interface, because
they are all preprocessor directives.

Attaching one to `CHEAT_GET(name)` or `cheat_check()` should work instead.

### 5.7   Printing

Streams are captured by default, so
it is not possible to print things on the screen while the tests are running.

However using the `CHEAT_NO_WRAP` option with
the `--dangerous` option allows bypassing stream capturing.
